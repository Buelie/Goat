# Brief introduction

To be honest, this project was originally a web project, and then I worked with others to revise it, write it for more than 40 days, and recently rewrote the project, which is also open sourced on Github 

# Installation and use

 Our SDK and API are for all python programmers, because some newbies don't know the pip command, so our SDK and API take a relatively earthy approach, download it first, and then import them into the files you need (of course, if you want to download with the pip command, the pip command is: pip install goat-chifeng-mochizuki)

 # Our official website
 
 Where is our official website?In this(http://goat.eu.org) Can't access? Please check your network settings!

 # Thanks
 
 I developed this project with others, and I would like to thank them(Sunset #6184,Eagle Lingyun #2491...)

 # frequently asked questions

+ Why rewrite documentation in English?Because writing in English is easy to manage, and bugs are greatly reduced when writing programs
+ Why are KOOK bots no longer supported?Because supporting KOOK bots at the same time greatly increases our workload, and our project is not perfect, we no longer support KOOK bots (if you want to use GoatSDK and API that supports KOOK bots, use V0.3.2 or below, of course, it is possible to support KOOK bots later)
+ Does the project support languages other than Java and Python?So far, the actual available languages in addition to Java and Python are JS, TS, HTML, CSS
+ Is this SDK and API suitable for beginners?The answer is yes, our program is aimed at anyone from novice to god level
 
# grammar

+ I don't want to write for now, don't read it
+ How do I import a class?Follow the following code to import (only the file name, no suffix required):
```
from FileName import ClassName
```
+ Use examples
```
from goat import wel
print(wel.welsdk)
Output the result:
>>> welcome to goat
```
