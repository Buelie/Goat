# Goat 
- Brief introduction
Goat, originally a KOOK (formerly Kai Hei) robot SDK, but after our team's magic modification, it became a multi-language SDK (of course, because I am in China, it is not very convenient to access Github, so I put most of the SDK on Git Code), if you want to learn or download the latest version of SDK and API you can go to our website (domain name: goat.eu.org) to download and learn, we provide three languages for the website, English, Chinese Simplified and Chinese Traditional. Worried about not linking to a website? Don't worry, this site is open outside of China. Our website also does not need to log in to register, you can download and learn directly, if you want to become a developer, it may be a bit difficult for you, because you need to learn well Chinese to become our developer. Finally, do not use it commercially
